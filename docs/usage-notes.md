### Troubleshooting
1. Copy and pasting images into the text editor for Mac Users

    You may find you are not able to copy (Cmd+c) and paste (Cmd+v) an image from the "Preview" application. As a workaround,     there are other ways to paste stuff into the text editor such as dragging and dropping a screenshot image or a file.

## For Linux Users
After downloading the AppImage file, you should be able to run CATcher by clicking on the
AppImage file.
If this does not work, you may need to allow the file to be executed.
There are 2 methods to achieve this:
- From the GUI:
  - Right click on the file icon
  - Select `Properties`, then select `Permissions`
  - Enable the `Allow executing file as program` option. 
  - Note: the GUI menus may differ slightly on different Linux distributions.
- From the command line: Use `chmod +x CATcher-x.y.z.AppImage`
