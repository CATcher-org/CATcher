# Workflow
When a pull request is merged, it should be accompanied by a helpful commit message.
[Here](https://oss-generic.github.io/process/docs/FormatsAndConventions.html#commit-message) are
some good guidelines for crafting the commit message.

Contributors can propose a commit message for their pull requests.

# Testing

We use [Scuri](https://github.com/gparlakov/scuri) to generate spec files for unit tests.

To generate spec files for files that have none.
`npm run ng g scuri:spec --name src/app/app.component.ts`

To generate spec files for files that have existing spec files.
`npm run ng g scuri:spec --name src/app/app.component.ts --force`

Scuri uses [Jasmine's spy feature](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Spies) to stub dependencies.

We loosely follow [this style guide](https://github.com/CareMessagePlatform/jasmine-styleguide) when writing tests. One main guideline is that a `describe` block should be created for each method / scenario under test, and an `it` block should be created for each property being verified.

# Future Developments
Here are a few suggestions that future developers can work on to improve this application!

## Support Commenting
Currently, the application only support 1 response for each phase. So a commenting section would be good to allow discussions between team members as well as between tutors and admins.
