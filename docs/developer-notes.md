# Setting up 
This section guides you through the steps required to set up your computer for developing CATcher.

## Prerequisites
You need Node 12 to develop this project. 
Run `node -v` in your OS terminal to check the version of Node on your computer. 

If you do not have Node 12 installed in your computer, click on [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.20.0/) to download Node 12. 

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository into your Github account.

2. Clone the forked repository into your computer.

3. Install dependencies with npm: Run `npm install`.

4. Compile and start the application: Run `npm start`.

## Debugging with Visual Studio Code
You can use Visual Studio Code to debug CATcher with Chrome, Firefox or Edge.
Refer to the `Debugging Angular` section of [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/angular-tutorial#_debugging-angular) for a step-by-step walkthrough of the debugger setup.

In summary, the following steps are needed:

1. Install the `Debugger for Chrome` extension for VS Code. You can also install debugger extensions for Firefox and Edge.

2. Create VS Code's debugger config file (`launch.json` ) as shown in [the guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/angular-tutorial#_debugging-angular). Particularly, set the `url` attribute to `http://localhost:4200` (reason: CATcher app is served locally on port 4200, by default.)

3. In the root project folder, run `ng serve`.

4. In VS Code's Debug View, launch the debugger by clicking the green arrow (or F5). You should see the CATcher app loading within a new browser window.

# Commands
This section shows you different commands you can run to build the application in different operating systems.

**Before building the application using the build commands below, go to `index.html` and comment out the necessary `base href` as explained in the file.**


|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm start`| Start the app from Electron in development mode. |
|`npm run ng:serve:web`| Start the app from the browser in development mode. |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |
|`npm run deploy:web`| Will deploy the app onto the Github's `gh-pages` branch. <br/> Prerequisites:<br/> 1. Add Environment variable of `GH_TOKEN=<Github Personal Access Token>` with the permission of `repo`. <br/>2. `build:prod:web` command's `--base-href` argument in `package.json` must have the following format `https://<OrgName or Username>.github.io/CATcher/`. <br/> 3. If you are deploying outside of CATcher-org then it would be necessary to create a new OAuth application and change the `clientId` in `environment.prod.ts` <br/> 4. If you are deploying outside of CATcher-org, you would also need to deploy your own instance of proxy server using [gatekeeper](https://github.com/CATcher-org/gatekeeper) and change the appropriate variables in `environment.prod.ts`. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs the linter (TSLint) |

# Workflow

The following is the workflow that contributors need to follow when proposing changes to CATcher.

## Submitting PRs

When a pull request is merged, it should be accompanied by a helpful commit message. Hence, contributors are recommended to propose a commit message for their pull requests.
[Here](https://oss-generic.github.io/process/docs/FormatsAndConventions.html#commit-message) are
some good guidelines for crafting the commit message.

## Testing

We use [Scuri](https://github.com/gparlakov/scuri) to generate spec files for unit tests.
Scuri uses [Jasmine's spy feature](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Spies) to stub dependencies.

### Generating Spec Files

- To generate spec files for files that have none:
    Run `npm run ng g scuri:spec --name src/app/app.component.ts`

- To generate spec files for files that have existing spec files:  
    Run `npm run ng g scuri:spec --name src/app/app.component.ts --force`

### Style Guide 

We loosely follow the [Jasmine Style Guide](https://github.com/CareMessagePlatform/jasmine-styleguide) when writing tests. 
One main guideline is that a `describe` block should be created for each method / scenario under test, and an `it` block should be created for each property being verified.

# Implementation

## Overview
To understand how the various types of users (software testers, developers, tutors) interact with CATcher, refer to the README at the [templates](https://github.com/CATcher-org/templates) repository. This document also provides the formats that must be followed in order for GitHub comments to be successfully parsed by CATcher.

## User authentication

CATcher uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate users. Below is a summary of the authentication process:

1. A user launches CATcher, and is prompted to log into GitHub. This is a direct interaction between the user and GitHub. Once the user has logged in, GitHub provides CATcher with an authorization code meant for this user.

2. CATcher sends this authorization code and its own client secret to GitHub's authorization server - in exchange for an access token.

3. Authentication is complete, and CATcher can now use the access token when it uses the GitHub API for its logic (e.g. submitting new issues, editing existing issues)

The authentication process is kicked off in the `AuthComponent`, but the code that co-ordinates steps 1 and 2 can be found in [`oauth.ts`](../oauth.ts)(For Electron) or `AuthService`(For Web). Step 2 requires a client secret granted to CATcher. To protect this, we run a web service, [gatekeeper](https://github.com/CATcher-org/gatekeeper) that executes step 2 on behalf of the client CATcher app.


# Future Developments
Here are a few suggestions that future developers can work on to improve this application!

## Support Commenting
Currently, the application only support 1 response for each phase. So a commenting section would be good to allow discussions between team members as well as between tutors and admins.
