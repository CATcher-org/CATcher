[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CATcher-org/CATcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CATcher-org/CATcher)

**CAT**cher is a desktop application for **C**rowd-sourced **A**nonymous **T**esting software. It uses GitHub as the backend for hosting bug reports.

This application will support the following order of workflow:
1. **Bug Reporting**: Testers will be informed of the teams they will be testing. Following which, they will be able to start creating new bug reports during this phase.
2. **Team's Response**: Teams will be able to respond to the bugs that are reported during the bug _reporting phase_.
3. **Tester's Response**: Testers will be able to respond to the team's acknowledgement / rejection of the bugs submitted.
3. **Evaluation**: Tutors and Admins will be able to view the bug reports and their respective teams' response. They can evaluate the responses, change the severity and status of the bug reports if needed.
